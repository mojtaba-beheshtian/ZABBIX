Overview

    In this section you can learn the meaning of some terms commonly used in Zabbix.

Definitions

1-host

    - a networked device that you want to monitor, with IP/DNS.

2-host group

    - a logical grouping of hosts; it may contain hosts and templates. Hosts and templates within a host group are not in any way linked to each other. Host groups are used when assigning access rights to hosts for different user groups.

3-item

    - a particular piece of data that you want to receive off of a host, a metric of data.

4-trigger

    - a logical expression that defines a problem threshold and is used to “evaluate” data received in items

When received data are above the threshold, triggers go from 'Ok' into a 'Problem' state. When received data are below the threshold, triggers stay in/return to an 'Ok' state.

5-event

    - a single occurrence of something that deserves attention such as a trigger changing state or a discovery/agent auto-registration taking place

6-problem

    - a trigger that is in “Problem” state

7-action

    - a predefined means of reacting to an event.

An action consists of operations (e.g. sending a notification) and conditions (when the operation is carried out)

8-escalation

    - a custom scenario for executing operations within an action; a sequence of sending notifications/executing remote commands

9-media

    - a means of delivering notifications; delivery channel

10-notification

    - a message about some event sent to a user via the chosen media channel

11-remote command

    - a pre-defined command that is automatically executed on a monitored host upon some condition

12-template

    - a set of entities (items, triggers, graphs, screens, applications, low-level discovery rules, web scenarios) ready to be applied to one or several hosts

The job of templates is to speed up the deployment of monitoring tasks on a host; also to make it easier to apply mass changes to monitoring tasks. Templates are linked directly to individual hosts.

13-application

    - a grouping of items in a logical group

14-web scenario

    - one or several HTTP requests to check the availability of a web site

15-frontend

    - the web interface provided with Zabbix

16-Zabbix API

    - Zabbix API allows you to use the JSON RPC protocol to create, update and fetch Zabbix objects (like hosts, items, graphs and others) or perform any other custom tasks

17-Zabbix server

    - a central process of Zabbix software that performs monitoring, interacts with Zabbix proxies and agents, calculates triggers, sends notifications; a central repository of data

18-Zabbix agent

    - a process deployed on monitoring targets to actively monitor local resources and applications

19-Zabbix proxy
    
    - a process that may collect data on behalf of Zabbix server, taking some processing load off of the server
